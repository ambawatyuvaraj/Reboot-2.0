Problem #1     Block System call : [ INCOMPLETE ]
  
    We can block syscalls using:
      ->SElinux
      ->Seccomp
      -> or use ptrace(2) or play ld.so tricks (LD_PRELOAD or LD_LIBRARY_PATH ones) or patch your libc 





Problem #2 :  play with directory 
  
    Q->   Create a directory without name from command line
    Ans-> mkdir ' '
    
    Q->   Create a directory with name "-okgoogle"
    Ans-> mkdir -- -okgoogle



Problem#3 : Create a directory structure [ Note: You are only allowed to use a single command and only one time ]
      
     Ans-> mkdir -p A/{B/{G/K/reboot.txt,H/J/reboot.txt},C/{I/J/reboot.txt,J/L/reboot.txt},D/{F/L/reboot.txt,E/M/reboot.txt}}
     

Problem #4.  Share and Files and Folder
    
     Q-> Create two users name jack and Jill  from command line
     Ans:  -> adduser jack [adduser command to create the user ]
           -> passwd jack  [ passwd command to set the password for the user ]
           
           -> adduser jill [adduser command to create the user ]
           -> passwd jill  [ passwd command to set the password for the user ]
           
     Q->login with jack user and create a file name  jack.txt using vim editor and write "hello jack"
     Ans:     -> su - jack  [su to switch user ]
               -> vim jack.txt [Press i to enter the insert mode and write "hello jack" and then Press escape and :wq to write and quit the file.]
     
     Q-> From jack user also create two directories name jack1 & jack2 
     Ans-> mkdir jack1 jack2
     
     Q-> Now login from Jill user and create a file. Jill.txt using vim editor and write "hey jiil"
     Ans:      -> su - jill [su to switch user]
                -> vim jill.txt [Press i to enter the insert mode and write "hey jill" and then Press Escape and :wq to write and quit the file.]
     
     Q-> From Jill also create two directoires named jill1 & jill2 
     Ans-> mkdir jill1 jill2
     
     Q-> Swap these files and directories in between users  and to swap don't use root account.
     Ans: -> There are a few different ways to do this like adding both the users to same group etc. etc. but it is a recommended way. So we'll use ACL [ Access Control List ]
              to do this.
          -> We'll be using just one command:
                  1->  setfacl [Set File Access Control Lists To Set The Permissions ]  
                  
          -> First we'll do it for user "jack"
              -> su -jack [Switch to user jack]
              =>Since we already created all the files/folders we'll proceed with the permissions
              -> setfacl -m u:jill:rwx /home/jack [ -m is used to modify the current ACL(s) of file(s) , u is for user and rwx = read-write-execute permissions.]
              
              =>Now we'll do the same for user "jill"
              -> su - jill [ Switch to user Jill ]
              -> setfacl -m u:jack:rwx /home/jill
          
          => Now We'll test if it works correctly or not, To do this we'll create a file called jill2.txt inside Jack's home.
              
              ->touch /home/jack/jill2.txt
              ->Now use the ls command to check. Jill2.txt should be there.
           
 
Problem#5: Play With Files and Directories 
    
      Q-> Create  3 files named   abc.txt  ok  fine  g.txt  /tmp directory 
      Ans-> cd /tmp/ 
            touch abc.txt ok\ fine g.txt
       
      Q-> Create  4  directories   aa aaa aaaa  under  /tmp directory 
      Ans-> mkdir aa aaa aaaa under
      
      Q-> Give ls command to  list the content of  /tmp directory 
      Ans-> ls [Since we're alr in /tmp dir]
      
      Q-> Make sure it will only list the content (file|directory)  having 2 char in their name.
      Ans-> ls -l ?? [ ? represents any single character.]
      

Problem#5: Run command without any output 
  
      Q-> Open terminal and type any command, once you press enter your output of given command must not  print you are not allowed to redirect output anywhere 
      Ans-> We can do this in two different ways
                1. Using "screen" 
                2. By using "--dump-strings"
                
                1: screen -dm ls [Command will execute with no output.]
                2: bash --dump-strings
                   date [No Output]
